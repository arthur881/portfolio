<h1>Hello world</h1>
<h2>Welcome to my portfolio repo!</h2>

<p>For all those who are interested in the project you can find it at the following address: https://portfolio-3sjjuc9mw-arthur881.vercel.app/</p>
I deployed it thanks to Vercel, by linking my gitHub repo to Vercel. I also linked the commits of the repo to a discord server thanks to Zapier. 
I installed Imgbot, it is a friendly robot that optimizes your images and saves you time. Optimized images mean smaller file sizes without sacrificing quality.
But also CodeFactor witch instantly performs Code Review with every GitHub Commit or PR. Zero setup time. Get actionable feedback within seconds

Thank you for your attention :)
